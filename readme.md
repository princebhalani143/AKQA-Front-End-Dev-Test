#AKQA Front End Dev Freelancer Test

This is the test and my solution to it. Be aware I submitted this test twice and the 1st time they accepted it and wanted to book me, but the 2nd time they said it wasn't good enough.

* produced efficient JavaScript
* didn’t put any comments in his code
* didn’t use any progressive enhancers
* the JavaScript sat on top of the HTML but it was external
* CSS was also very basic

I'm not sure what they mean by this.
